## Executive Summary
This report summarizes the findings from the 2025-01-22 network traffic capture. The Windows host `10.1.17.215` (DESKTOP-L8C5GSJ / MAC `00:d0:b7:26:4a:74`, user `shutchenson`) downloaded a malicious file from a fake Google Authenticator website. After infection, the host communicated with several command-and-control (C2) servers.  

During the initial review, one C2 IP (`45.125.66.32`) was missed. In this report, this host is included in the confirmed list of C2 endpoints.

## Victim Details
- **IP address:** `10.1.17.215`  
- **Hostname:** `DESKTOP-L8C5GSJ`  
- **Windows user account:** `shutchenson`  
- **MAC address:** `00:d0:b7:26:4a:74`  
- **Domain / AD:** `BLUEMOONTUESDAY`  
- **Domain Controller:** `10.1.17.2`

---

## Malicious Site
- **Fake software site used for infection:** `authenticatoor.org` (fake Google Authenticator page)

---

## C2 IP Addresses (Post-Infection)
- `5.252.153.241`  
- `45.125.66.32`  ← *previously missed in initial review*  
- `45.125.66.252`

---

## Observed Traffic
- Initial HTTP requests to the fake Google Authenticator page, followed by payload downloads.  
- Long-lived TCP connections (>600 seconds) to external IPs, indicating possible persistent C2 connections.  
- HTTP GET requests to `/api/file/get-file/...` including PowerShell scripts (`.ps1`).  
- TLS certificates with unusual common names, including `google-authenticator.burleson-appliance.net`.

---

## Why `45.125.66.32` Was Missed
- **Filter limitations:** Scripts were focused on long-duration connections or exact URI matches. The missed IP may have had shorter connections or slightly different URI patterns.  
- **Log selection:** Some connections appeared in logs not included in the summary.  
- **Payload location:** The IP was possibly embedded in response data, not top-level HTTP host fields.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Isolate the infected host** from the network.  
2. **Collect host artifacts** (memory, file system) for malware analysis.  
3. **Block C2 IPs** at the firewall.  
4. **Hunt for lateral movement** on the domain controller and internal servers.  
5. **Share confirmed indicators** (IPs, domains, file hashes) with the SOC team or threat intelligence feeds.

## Summary
The exercise confirmed that the host `10.1.17.215` was infected by a malicious file from a fake Google Authenticator site and communicated with three C2 servers. Including `45.125.66.32` provides a complete view of post-infection activity. This workflow provides a repeatable method for future traffic analysis investigations.
