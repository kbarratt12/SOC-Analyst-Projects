# SOC Automation Project Report

## Executive Summary

This project successfully implemented a comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) automation workflow that detects malicious activity, analyzes threats, and automatically creates security incidents with email notifications. The implementation demonstrates a complete security monitoring pipeline from endpoint detection through automated response.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal was to create an automated security incident response system that:
- Detects malicious activity on Windows endpoints using Sysmon
- Centralizes log collection and analysis with Wazuh SIEM
- Performs automated threat intelligence lookups via VirusTotal
- Creates security incidents in TheHive case management platform  
- Sends email notifications to security analysts

## Technical Architecture

### Infrastructure Components

**Cloud Infrastructure (Digital Ocean)**
- Wazuh SIEM server for log collection and analysis
- TheHive incident management platform
- Firewall configuration restricting access to authorized IP addresses

**Local Environment**
- Windows 10 virtual machine as monitored endpoint
- Sysmon for detailed system monitoring and logging
- VirtualBox for virtualization management

**Automation Platform**
- Shuffle SOAR for workflow orchestration and automation

### Key Integrations

1. **Sysmon → Wazuh**: Endpoint telemetry collection
2. **Wazuh → Shuffle**: Alert triggering via webhook
3. **Shuffle → VirusTotal**: Automated threat intelligence enrichment
4. **Shuffle → TheHive**: Incident case creation
5. **Shuffle → Email**: Analyst notification system

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- Deployed Windows 10 VM with Sysmon installation for comprehensive system monitoring
- Established Digital Ocean cloud infrastructure for hosting security tools
- Configured restrictive firewall rules for secure remote access
- Set up SSH connectivity for secure remote administration

### Phase 2: SIEM Deployment and Configuration
- Installed and configured Wazuh SIEM following official documentation
- Integrated Windows VM as Wazuh agent for log collection
- Configured Sysmon log ingestion through ossec.conf modifications
- Enabled comprehensive logging (logall and logall_json) for complete audit trail
- Set up Filebeat for log shipping to Elasticsearch
- Created custom index patterns for archived logs

### Phase 3: Custom Detection Rules
- Developed custom Wazuh detection rule (ID: 100002) for Mimikatz detection
- Configured rule with severity level 15 for high-priority alerts
- Mapped detection to MITRE ATT&CK framework (T1003 - Credential Dumping)
- Validated rule effectiveness through controlled testing

### Phase 4: Automation Workflow Development
- Created Shuffle workflow with webhook trigger for Wazuh integration
- Implemented regex pattern matching for SHA256 hash extraction
- Configured VirusTotal API integration for automated malware analysis
- Set up TheHive integration for incident case management
- Developed email notification system for analyst alerts

## Technical Challenges and Resolutions

### Challenge 1: VM Infrastructure Issues
**Problem**: Accidental snapshot corruption requiring complete rebuild
**Resolution**: Recreated VDI using VirtualBox CLI and reinstalled all components. Developed expertise in snapshot management, sorting, and VDI restoration using command-line interface

### Challenge 2: VM Guest Additions Configuration
**Problem**: Unable to copy/paste between host and guest systems, hindering workflow efficiency
**Resolution**: Fixed VM Guest Additions installation to enable clipboard sharing and improved development workflow

### Challenge 3: Elasticsearch Service Configuration
**Problem**: Elasticsearch service failing to start due to incorrect JVM options and cluster settings
**Resolution**: 
- Corrected JVM configuration parameters
- Updated Elasticsearch cluster settings with `discovery.type: single-node` for standalone deployment
- Validated service startup and functionality

### Challenge 4: TheHive URL Configuration and Documentation Issues
**Problem**: Initial 60-second timeout failures due to incorrect URL configuration and outdated documentation
**Resolution**: 
- Researched and implemented current TheHive documentation standards
- Corrected API endpoint URLs for proper connectivity
- Identified need for additional security measures (XPack authentication, Cassandra login security) for future implementation

### Challenge 5: Geographic Cloud Instance Optimization
**Problem**: Initially suspected UK cloud instance location was causing 30-second timeout issues
**Resolution**: 
- Migrated to US-based cloud instance for potentially improved latency
- Reconfigured webhook API endpoints for new geographic location
- Validated connectivity improvements

### Challenge 6: Wazuh-Shuffle Integration
**Problem**: Webhook integration failing due to XML indentation errors
**Resolution**: Corrected ossec.conf XML formatting through careful syntax validation

### Challenge 7: VirusTotal API Integration
**Problem**: 404 errors due to incorrect hash field extraction from JSON payloads
**Resolution**: Refined regex capture group implementation using `$sha256_hash.group_0.#` syntax for precise hash extraction

### Challenge 8: TheHive JSON Formatting
**Problem**: 400 errors due to invalid TLP and severity field formatting in API calls
**Resolution**: Corrected JSON structure by removing quotes from numeric severity values and validating TLP field formats

## Testing and Validation

### Test Scenario: Mimikatz Execution
1. **Trigger**: Executed Mimikatz credential dumping tool on monitored Windows endpoint
2. **Detection**: Sysmon captured process execution details
3. **Analysis**: Wazuh processed logs and triggered custom detection rule
4. **Enrichment**: Workflow extracted file hash and queried VirusTotal
5. **Response**: Created incident case in TheHive with threat intelligence
6. **Notification**: Sent email alert to security analyst

**Result**: Complete workflow execution with successful incident creation and notification

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures
- IP address restrictions on cloud infrastructure
- SSH-based secure remote access
- Microsoft Defender exclusions for controlled malware testing
- Firewall rules limiting external connectivity

### Areas for Enhancement
- Implement more granular RBAC in TheHive
- Add encrypted communication channels
- Deploy additional endpoint agents for broader coverage
- Implement log retention and archival policies
- **Future Security Hardening**: Implement XPack authentication for Elasticsearch and proper Cassandra authentication for TheHive
- **Infrastructure Resilience**: Develop standardized VM snapshot and backup procedures
- **Geographic Optimization**: Consider multi-region deployment strategies for improved global performance

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation Accuracy**: Using outdated documentation led to significant configuration issues; always verify against current official sources and maintain awareness of version-specific requirements
2. **Infrastructure Planning**: VM snapshot strategy is critical for maintaining stable test environments; developed proficiency in CLI-based snapshot management and VDI restoration procedures
3. **Integration Testing**: Small formatting errors can cause complete workflow failures; thorough testing of each integration point is essential
4. **Security vs. Functionality**: Balancing restrictive security controls with functional requirements requires careful planning
5. **System Administration Best Practices**: Utilized elevated PowerShell and CMD prompts for proper privilege management during configuration tasks
6. **Troubleshooting Methodology**: Developed systematic log analysis skills across multiple platforms (Elasticsearch, Wazuh, TheHive, Shuffle) for effective problem resolution
7. **Geographic Considerations**: Cloud instance location can impact service connectivity and performance; geographic proximity may affect integration reliability
8. **Service Dependencies**: Understanding the relationship between Elasticsearch, TheHive, and associated services is crucial for successful deployment
9. **Development Environment Optimization**: VM Guest Additions and host-to-guest connectivity features significantly improve development efficiency

Shuffle orchestrates enrichment through VirusTotal, creates cases in TheHive, and sends email notifications to SOC analysts, with bidirectional response actions flowing back through the system.*
