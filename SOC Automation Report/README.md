This project was to show what was possible by fully automating detection to case creation. I used Sysmon to generate an alert for mimikatz and then I set it up to wehre that sysmon alert triggered an alert in Wazuh. Once that alert in Wazuh was triggered then it automatically went in to Shuffle where a SHA-256 hash was pulled out using Regex. This hash was fed into VirusTotal where its exact identity was confirmed. THen I had TheHive set up where once that was confirmed then it created a case with all the important details. Finally, it sent out an email to the "analyst" that there was a case created on their account.
